This is a code for the Data Science Challenge

The python notebook 'ModelBuilding.ipynb' captures the entire journey of building a predictive model. 

The various steps involved that are captured in the python notebook are,
1.Importing the required Packages
2.Reading the dataset
3.Data Formatting
4.Data Exploration
5.EDA Observation
6.Model Building
7.Feature Importance
8.Model Evaluation
9.Saving Model
10.Meassuring Accuracy
11.Getting User Input
12.Prediction for User Input


The python script 'predict_based_on_input.py' is used to make the prediction based on usage of the saved 
model to predict for a custom input from the user.

There are sufficient comments in the code to enable any other data scientist to take this up and continue improving the model.

All the predictive model files are saved in the folder 'Model'

Not sure where to start?
1. Check the python notebook code(.ipynb) to review the prediction process
2. Execute the python code(.py) to make prediction for a custom input
