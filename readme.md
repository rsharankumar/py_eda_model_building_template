About Dataset:
<br />
The file ​cats.csv​ contains data with details of 300 different cats. These data should be used to create a predictive model that can be used to predict the life expectancy, in years, of any cat.
<br />
<br />
The python notebook 'ModelBuilding.ipynb' captures the entire journey of building a predictive model. 
<br />
<br />
The various steps involved that are captured in the python notebook are,<br />
1.Importing the required Packages<br />
2.Reading the dataset<br />
3.Data Formatting<br />
4.Data Exploration<br />
5.EDA Observation<br />
6.Model Building<br />
7.Feature Importance<br />
8.Model Evaluation<br />
9.Saving Model<br />
10.Meassuring Accuracy<br />
11.Getting User Input<br />
12.Prediction for User Input<br />
<br />
<br />
The python script 'predict_based_on_input.py' is used to make the prediction based on usage of the saved 
model to predict for a custom input from the user.<br />
<br />
There are sufficient comments in the code to enable any other data scientist to take this up and continue improving the model.<br />
<br />
All the predictive model files are saved in the folder 'Model'<br />
<br />
Not sure where to start?<br />
1. Check the python notebook code(.ipynb) to review the prediction process<br />
2. Execute the python code(.py) to make prediction for a custom input<br />
